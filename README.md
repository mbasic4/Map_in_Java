# Map_in_Java
Code is written in Java and it uses Processing and Unfolding Maps library functions. Map is showing locations of earthquakes around 
the world. Each earthquake is represented by different color depending on its magnitude.
Inside "UCSDUnfoldingMaps" folder is "src" folder with codes. Main code is inside the "module3" folder under the name 
"EarthquakeCityMap.java". This code is showing a map as described above and you can zoom in and out of the map, and also pan it. Blue 
color shows minor eathquakes, yellow color shows light earthquakes and red color shows the remaining moderate, strong, major and great 
earthquakes. Parser that was used inside this code is provided by Coursera's Object Oriented Programming in Java (University of 
California, San Diego) course and can be found inside a "parsing" folder ("ParseFeed.java").
There is also a small fun code inside "guimodule" folder named "MyPApplet.java". When ran as an application, it starts an Applet Viewer 
which shows a background picture of Zadar, a town in North Dalmatia (Croatia) and a yellow circle. Yellow circle represents a sun which 
changes colors gradually every 30 seconds from yellow to black and vice versa.
